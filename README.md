# CleanCodeScaffold
CleanCodeScaffold is a .NET Core project template following Clean Code Architecture. It provides generic CRUD operations, modular layers, and easy testing. Start your projects with clean, maintainable code. Contributions welcome!

CleanCodeScaffold is a generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project template built on the principles of Clean Code Architecture. It serves as a foundation for developing robust, maintainable, and scalable .NET Core applications while emphasizing clean, modular, and testable code practices.

Key Features:

Clean Code Architecture: Follows the Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture pattern, separating core business logic from external concerns.

Generic CRUD Operations: Provides generic implementations for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, allowing you to focus on domain-specific logic.

Dependency Injection: Utilizes .NET Core's built-in Dependency Injection to manage object lifetimes and facilitate loosely coupled components.

Modular Structure: Organized into layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure) for clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.

Testing Support: Designed with testability in mind, allowing you to write unit tests and ensure the reliability of your codebase.

Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies using .NET CLI or your preferred package manager.
Customize the domain-specific logic in the Application Layer.
Run the application and start building your features on top of the clean architecture foundation.
